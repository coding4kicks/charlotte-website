                        <p>Sound familiar?  Can this marriage be saved?  <em>Just My TYPE</em>, an original musical comedy, explores how the four pairs of personality traits, based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator® assessment, affect one’s loves and life.  As the show opens, psychologists Kate and Ben face a deadline to write a book on personality types.  They use four couples from their own practice to illustrate what happens when opposites mate, i.e. an introvert marries an extrovert; a thinker weds a feeler.  The couples’ attractions, conflicts, and resolutions (or lack thereof) are played out as scenes move between five settings from Puget Sound to Santa Monica to Big Stone Gap, VA. Kate and Ben learn something about themselves in the process.  So will the audience.  Twenty-one original songs set just the right tone, and two actors play all ten roles. </p>
