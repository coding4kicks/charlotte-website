                    <h3>Advance praise for JONAS SALK:</h3>

                    <blockquote>"The story of Jonas Salk is an endlessly fascinating one and in Charlotte Jacobs’s capable hands this will be a winner, an important book."</blockquote>

                    <blockquote>"What is clear immediately in reading the first few pages of this new work is how fascinating, complex and relevant the life story of Jonas Salk is to our lives today.  The research Charlotte Jacobs has already done, including access to never-before available sources, makes for the setting of a fascinating tale.  The writing, no surprise, is spirited, informed both by her scientific and medical knowledge and her writer's art.  <br> This book will be another significant contribution to the history of medical research in the 20th century.  Following her fine biography of Henry Kaplan, Jacobs has found an even more compelling subject in Jonas Salk.  Tracing interactions between his personal life and his public story; between the poles of a private man repeatedly thrust into (and craving) the public arena; and most important, the first fully informed examination of a major figure in medical research in this country is a daunting task to take on.  As she amply demonstrated in her Kaplan biography, Charlotte Jacobs is uniquely equipped to get it done.”</blockquote>
