                        <h1>Jonas Salk: A LIFE</h1>

                        <p>Jonas Salk was born on October 28, 1914, in East Harlem.  He was just a child when poliomyelitis and then influenza devastated New York.  Spared, he would one day play a major role in the prevention of both.  Salk’s work on the influenza vaccine would go largely unrecognized.  His polio vaccine, however, would catapult him into a world of celebrity from which he could never extricate himself.  When a waiting world learned on April 12, 1955, that his vaccine could prevent poliomyelitis, Jonas Salk became a hero overnight.  Born in a New York tenement, humble in manner, he had all the makings of a twentieth-century icon—a white knight in a white coat.  Beloved by the public, he was shunned by the scientific community, the one group whose adulation he craved.  A brilliant success at age forty, Jonas Salk had half a lifetime to prove himself.</p>
