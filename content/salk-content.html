						<h1>Jonas Salk: American Icon, Scientific Outcast</h1>
                        <p>Jonas Salk was born on October 28, 1914, in East Harlem.  He was just a child when poliomyelitis and then influenza devastated New York.  Spared, he would one day play a major role in the prevention of both.  Salk’s work on the influenza vaccine would go largely unrecognized.  His polio vaccine, however, would catapult him into a world of celebrity from which he could never extricate himself.  When a waiting world learned on April 12, 1955, that his vaccine could prevent poliomyelitis, Jonas Salk became a hero overnight.  Born in a New York tenement, humble in manner, he had all the makings of a twentieth-century icon—a white knight in a white coat.  Beloved by the public, he was shunned by the scientific community, the one group whose adulation he craved.  A brilliant success at age forty, Jonas Salk had half a lifetime to recast himself.</p>
                        <p>To date, Jacobs has reviewed the Jonas Salk Archives at UCSD, including some previously unavailable material, as well as records from the March of Dimes Archives in White Plains, New York, and Salk’s video-taped interviews.  She has conducted ninety interviews.  The anticipated completion date of Jonas Salk: American Icon, Scientific Outcast is late 2013.</p>
